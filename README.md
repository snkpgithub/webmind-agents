# 🤖 WebMind Agents

Welcome to **WebMind Agents** — a collection of intelligent browser automation agents inspired by the **"Building AI Browser Agents"** course by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with **AGI Inc**. These projects explore how AI agents can interact with the web autonomously, make decisions, and plan actions intelligently.

Developed under the guidance of **Div Garg** and **Naman Garg**, this repo showcases three progressively advanced browser agents with real code examples and planning logic.

## 🧠 Notebooks Included

### 1. `Building_a_Simple_Web_Agent.ipynb`
> A lightweight web agent capable of performing basic actions like clicking, typing, and navigating using browser automation tools.

### 2. `Building_an_Autonomous_Web_Agents.ipynb`
> Builds on the simple agent to add autonomy — including action selection and task completion using planning and context awareness.

### 3. `MCTS_and_AgentQ.ipynb`
> Implements **Agent Q** using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to create a decision-making agent that selects optimal actions based on a search tree of possible futures.
