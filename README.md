# 🤖 WebMind Agents

Welcome to **WebMind Agents** — a collection of intelligent, autonomous browser automation agents designed to showcase the future of AI-driven web interaction. This project is inspired by the **"Building AI Browser Agents"** short course by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with **[AGI Inc](https://www.theagi.company/)**.

Through this repository, you'll explore how modern agents can:
- **Perceive** and interpret dynamic web environments,
- **Plan** actions using decision-making algorithms like **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**,
- And **act autonomously** across websites to complete complex tasks — much like a human.

This hands-on implementation was developed under the guidance of leading minds in the AI agent space: **Div Garg**, **Naman Garg**, and **Andrew Ng**. Each notebook demonstrates progressively advanced capabilities — from basic automation to real-time reasoning and forward planning.

Whether you're an AI practitioner, developer, or researcher, this project will give you insights into building browser-native AI agents capable of intelligent decision-making. It’s also a great foundation to explore how LLMs, planning algorithms, and interaction models can be integrated into real-world use cases like web automation, research bots, and intelligent task assistants.

## 🧠 Notebooks Included

### 1. `Building_a_Simple_Web_Agent.ipynb`
> A lightweight web agent capable of performing basic actions like clicking, typing, and navigating using browser automation tools.

### 2. `Building_an_Autonomous_Web_Agents.ipynb`
> Builds on the simple agent to add autonomy — including action selection and task completion using planning and context awareness.

### 3. `MCTS_and_AgentQ.ipynb`
> Implements **Agent Q** using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to create a decision-making agent that selects optimal actions based on a search tree of possible futures.
